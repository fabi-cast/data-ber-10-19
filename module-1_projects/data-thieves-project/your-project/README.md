## Project Description

In this project we do an exploratory analysis of the ocurrence of natural events (aka. disasters) like Severe Storms, Wildfires, Volcanoes, Earthquakes, etc. and its relationship with the global emissions of CO2 over the years. 

## Questions & Hypotheses

Primarily we want to ask the question: Is there a correlation between natural disasters ocurrences and emissions of CO2?

It is well known the fact that the emissions of CO2 contribute to the global warming phenomenon, but, are they related somehow with the ocurrences e.g. of Wildfires or severe storms?

## Dataset

### * Natural Events: 
We use the EONET API v.2.1 by NASA:  https://eonet.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/v2.1

### * CO2 emissions:
We extract datasets in xls format from Global carbon Atlas: http://globalcarbonatlas.org/en/CO2-emissions.
